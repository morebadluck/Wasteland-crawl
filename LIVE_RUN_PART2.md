## 💭 MY THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW

**Turn 501 - At the gates of Level 4:**

"I've come farther than most first-time characters. The vaults have been amazing - each one unique and challenging. That fire station nearly got me. No healing potions left is SCARY.

But I'm well equipped now: chain mail, long sword, level 4. Trog is with me. Let's see what horrors wait in the deep metro..."

**Prediction**: I'll either find good loot and push to Level 5... or I'll encounter an ogre and die horribly. That's the wasteland!

---

## 🎮 SHOULD I CONTINUE?

We're at a GREAT stopping point or a perfect place to push deeper!

**Options:**
1. **STOP HERE** - Great run, survived 500 turns, saw 8 vaults
2. **CONTINUE** - Push into Level 4, might find hospital or police station!
3. **GO FOR GLORY** - Try to reach Level 5 and see late-game vaults!

**What do you want to see?**

Level 4 will have ogres (terrifying!), more orc warriors, possibly our first **mid-game vault** like "Ruins Police Station" or "Ruins Hospital"!

Should TestSurvivor push their luck? 😊

*Turn 501: TestSurvivor stands at the threshold...*
