# Wasteland Crawl - Lore & World Building

## The Apocalypse: The Divine War

**What Happened:**
The world was not destroyed by human hands, but by the wrath of gods.

For eons, the celestial realms existed beyond mortal sight—the Heavens where angels sang, and the Hells where demons schemed. The gods maintained the balance, each ruling their domains. But when ancient conflicts reignited, the gods went to war.

**The Rift:**
In their fury, angels and demons tore open a rift between their realms and Earth. What started as a hairline fracture in reality became a gaping wound. Through this breach poured horrors beyond mortal comprehension—demons, undead, aberrations, and twisted creatures from the outer darkness.

The apocalypse was swift and merciless. Cities fell in days. Armies were slaughtered. Civilizations crumbled. Those who didn't flee were consumed by the endless tide of monsters. The few who survived did so by hiding, running, or sheer luck.

**300 Years Later:**
The rift still bleeds. The war between angels and demons continues, indifferent to the mortal suffering below. Earth has become a wasteland—a no-man's-land in a cosmic war that humanity never asked to join.

## The Wasteland Today

**300 Years After the Rift**

The surface world is a monster-infested wasteland:
- **Roaming horrors**: Demons, undead, and aberrations patrol the ruins
- **Divine storms**: When angels and demons clash overhead, reality itself warps—lightning that burns with holy fire or shadowy tempests that drain life
- **Corrupted land**: Areas touched by demonic influence twist into hellscapes; blessed zones become deadly to the unholy
- **Scarce resources**: Most pre-apocalypse infrastructure is rubble. Survivors scavenge ruins for scraps

**The Survivors:**
Humanity clings to existence in small, scattered groups:
- **Merchants**: Brave or desperate souls who risk the wasteland to trade goods between settlements. They know the safest routes and which monsters to avoid.
- **Safe Havens**: Fortified settlements—often built in the ruins of old cities or hidden in natural caves. They offer shelter, food, and rest to those who can pay or prove useful.
- **The Weak**: Most surviving humans are ordinary people—farmers, craftsmen, children. They lack the strength, skill, or magic to venture into the open wasteland. They huddle behind walls, praying the monsters don't find them.

Few dare to enter the dungeons. Fewer still return.

## The Dungeons: Remnants of the Divine War

**What They Are:**
The dungeons are **fragments of the celestial realms**—pieces of Heaven and Hell that broke off during the divine war and crashed into Earth. Some are angelic fortresses, others demonic strongholds. All are infested with the soldiers and horrors of both sides.

**Why They Exist:**
When the gods tore open the rift, chunks of their realms were ripped away and embedded in the Earth like shrapnel. These otherworldly structures sank deep underground, creating labyrinthine dungeons filled with treasures, relics, and abominations.

Each dungeon is a battlefield frozen in time—hallways where angels and demons fought to the death, throne rooms of fallen demon lords, sanctuaries where priests prayed for salvation that never came.

**Why Enter Them:**
- **Power**: Divine and infernal artifacts lie within—weapons blessed by angels, armor forged in Hell's foundries
- **Knowledge**: Ancient texts reveal the secrets of the gods and their war
- **The Rune Keys**: Four legendary artifacts hidden in the deepest dungeons. Together, they can unlock the path to the rift's heart
- **Wealth**: Gold, gems, and magical items beyond mortal reckoning
- **Truth**: The deeper you go, the closer you get to the rift itself—and the power to end the war, or use it for your own ascension

## Dungeon Depth Progression

### Early Levels (1-5): The Outer Vaults
**Description**: Recently breached chambers, still partially intact. These were servant quarters, storage rooms, and outer defenses of the ancient civilizations.

**Lore**: These areas were meant to be abandoned first in case of danger. Many were deliberately filled with traps and guardian constructs to keep intruders away from the deeper chambers.

**Monsters**:
- **Kobolds**: Scavengers who've lived in the upper levels for generations
- **Giant rats**: Mutated by magical radiation from the Convergence
- **Animated armor**: Guardian constructs left behind by the old mages
- **Goblins**: Wasteland tribes who discovered the entrances

### Mid Levels (6-10): The Living Quarters
**Description**: Residential and commercial districts of lost cities. Libraries, temples, workshops, and homes preserved in time.

**Lore**: Here lived the common people of the pre-Convergence civilizations. Their belongings, books, and art remain—offering glimpses into dozens of lost cultures. Some rooms show signs of hasty evacuation; others suggest the inhabitants never knew what was coming.

**Monsters**:
- **Undead**: Those who died during the Convergence, trapped in these sealed chambers
- **Naga**: Serpent-people from a dimension where reptiles evolved intelligence
- **Ogres**: Giants from a world where magic caused accelerated growth
- **Cultists**: Wasteland dwellers who've descended into madness, worshipping the Convergence as divine

### Late Levels (11+): The Deep Sanctums
**Description**: The heart of the preservation chambers. Royal palaces, arcane laboratories, and temples to forgotten gods. The walls hum with barely-contained power.

**Lore**: These chambers were meant to preserve the most important people and artifacts. Kings, archmages, high priests, and legendary warriors were sealed here along with their treasures. But the magic that preserved them also warped them—many became twisted, insane, or transformed into monsters.

**Monsters**:
- **Liches**: Mages who achieved immortality through dark rituals during the Convergence
- **Dragons**: Reality-warped creatures of immense power
- **Demons**: Entities from dimensions of pure chaos, unleashed during the Convergence
- **Stone giants**: Ancient guardians who've stood watch for 300 years
- **The Converged**: Horrifying fusions of multiple creatures from different dimensions

## The Races: Mortals in a Divine War

When the rift opened, it didn't just unleash monsters—it also brought beings from the celestial realms to Earth. Some are native to this world, others are refugees from Heaven, Hell, and stranger places. All struggle to survive in the wasteland.

**Humans**: The native inhabitants of Earth. Most died in the apocalypse. The survivors are hardy, adaptable, and desperate. They remember the world as it was and want it back.

**Hill Orcs**: Warriors from a martial plane allied with certain war gods. When their realm was consumed by the conflict, they fled to Earth. They value strength and glory in battle.

**Minotaurs**: Sacred guardians from ancient labyrinthine temples in the celestial realms. When those temples fell, they wandered through the rift to Earth, seeking new purpose.

**Merfolk**: Aquatic beings from a primordial ocean realm. They suffer in the dry wasteland but thrive in the underground rivers that run through some dungeons.

**Deep Elves**: Ancient magical beings who lived in Earth's deep places long before humanity. They foresaw the divine war and tried to warn the surface—no one listened.

**Spriggans**: Tiny fey creatures from the fringes of reality. Mischievous and fast, they slip between the cracks of the world to survive.

**Centaurs**: Children of nature spirits. They roam the wasteland, maintaining what little natural order remains.

**Nagas**: Serpent-people who served ancient chthonic deities. The divine war disrupted their slumber, and they've emerged into a ruined world.

**Trolls**: Creatures of raw regenerative magic. The ambient chaos of the rift accelerates their already formidable healing.

**Ghouls**: Humans cursed by exposure to necromantic energies from the rift. They require flesh to survive, but cannot truly die.

**Ogres**: Giants touched by infernal energies. Stronger than humans but dimmer, they make excellent shock troops or survivors.

**Formicids**: Insectoid beings from a hive beneath Earth's crust. The rift shattered their hive-mind, leaving individuals confused but free.

**Vine Stalkers**: Plant-people animated by druidic magic. They feed on the ambient magical corruption in the wasteland.

**Kobolds**: Small, scrappy reptilians who live in the upper levels of dungeons. They breed quickly and adapt to anything.

**Vampires**: Humans cursed by drinking demon blood. They gained power, but now hunger eternally for life force.

**Demigods**: Literal children of the warring gods. They were born mortal but carry divine blood, giving them great power and terrible responsibility.

**Demonspawn**: Humans tainted by infernal heritage. As they grow stronger, demonic mutations manifest in their bodies.

**Felids**: Shape-shifting cat-spirits. They have nine lives, making them reckless and bold.

**Octopodes**: Intelligent cephalopods from a deep ocean trench touched by eldritch power. They adapted to land after the apocalypse.

## The Gods: Warriors in the Divine Conflict

The gods are real, powerful, and at war. They are the cause of the apocalypse—and perhaps the only way to end it. Each god offers power to mortal followers in exchange for worship and service. Choose carefully; the gods are jealous, and betrayal carries dire consequences.

### Lawful / Angelic Gods:

**Zin the Law-Giver** - God of order and purity. Seeks to close the rift and restore cosmic law. Abhors chaos and mutation.

**The Shining One** - God of righteous warfare. Commands legions of angels. Demands the destruction of all demons and undead.

**Elyvilon the Healer** - Goddess of mercy and life. Opposes the violence of the war but cannot stop it. Offers healing to those who preserve life.

### Chaotic / Infernal Gods:

**Makhleb the Destroyer** - Demon lord of slaughter. Feeds on bloodshed and chaos. Grants power through carnage.

**Lugonu the Abyssal** - God of the void between realms. Seeks to expand the rift, consuming all reality into the Abyss.

**Kikubaaqudgha** - Demon prince of necromancy. Commands the legions of undead. Offers mastery over death itself.

### Neutral / Opportunistic Gods:

**Trog the Wrathful** - God of primal rage. Hates magic, which he sees as the cause of the war. Values pure physical strength.

**Okawaru the Warmaster** - God of honorable combat. Doesn't care about angels or demons—only that warriors prove their worth in battle.

**Sif Muna the Loremaven** - Goddess of knowledge and magic. Seeks to understand the rift and master its power for arcane purposes.

**Vehumet the Destructive** - God of offensive magic. Revels in the destructive potential unleashed by the divine war.

**Gozag Ym Sagoz** - God of greed. Doesn't care about the war—only profit. Offers gold and services to those who pay tribute.

**Ashenzari the Shackled** - God of divination. Sees all possible futures. Knows how the war ends, but cannot (or will not) act directly.

**Nemelex Xobeh** - God of fate and chance. Views the war as a cosmic game. Offers chaotic boons through divine luck.

*(All DCSS gods exist in this pantheon, each with their own stance on the divine war)*

## The Rune Keys: Path to the Rift

Deep in the most dangerous dungeons lie the **Four Rune Keys**—ancient artifacts of immense power, forged when the rift was first torn open. Each key is hidden in a different biome, guarded by the most fearsome creatures of the divine war.

**The Four Keys:**
1. **The Scorched Key** - Hidden in the Desert Dungeon, deep beneath the burning sands
2. **The Frozen Key** - Buried in the Ice Dungeon, in the heart of an eternal winter
3. **The Verdant Key** - Lost in the Jungle Dungeon, overgrown by primal chaos
4. **The Infernal Key** - Sealed in the Volcanic/Nether Dungeon, forged in hellfire itself

**Why Seek Them?**
The Four Rune Keys, when brought together, unlock the gates to **Zot**—the final dungeon at the very heart of the rift. Within Zot lies the **Orb of Zot**, an artifact of ultimate power rumored to be:
- A fragment of the original rift itself
- The key to closing the rift forever
- The source of the gods' power
- Or perhaps something far more dangerous

**The Quest:**
1. Explore the wasteland and find the four major dungeons (one in each biome)
2. Delve deep into each dungeon and claim its Rune Key
3. Use the Four Keys to unlock the entrance to Zot
4. Descend into Zot, facing the most dangerous creatures in existence
5. Retrieve the Orb of Zot
6. Escape back to the surface with the Orb to achieve victory

**What happens when you win?** That depends on your choices, your god, and what the Orb truly is...

## The Hell Branches: Optional Nightmares

For those seeking even greater challenges—and rewards—there exist passages to the Hell Branches. These are not required to win, but they offer the most powerful artifacts and toughest enemies in the game.

**Pandemonium**: A realm of pure chaos where demon lords rule over ever-shifting landscapes. Reality itself is unstable. Each visit generates a new, random hellscape. Countless demon lords dwell here, each guarding unique artifacts.

**Cocytus**: The frozen hell. A realm of eternal ice where traitors and betrayers are imprisoned in glaciers. Frozen undead wander the wasteland. At its heart rules a demon lord of absolute cold.

**Gehenna**: The volcanic hell. Rivers of lava, lakes of fire, and mountains of burning stone. Here dwell the most violent demons, those who revel in flame and fury.

**Tartarus**: The undead hell. A dark necropolis where the most powerful liches and death lords rule over legions of undead. The air itself drains life.

**The Abyss**: The void between realms, touched by Lugonu's influence. A nightmare dimension that shifts and changes randomly. Entering the Abyss is dangerous—escaping it is harder. But for those who risk it, powerful void-touched artifacts await.

Each Hell Branch is deadlier than Zot itself, but the rewards are legendary: weapons forged by demon lords, armor blessed by fallen angels, artifacts that grant god-like powers.

## Dungeon Encounters: Environmental Storytelling

As you descend deeper into the dungeons, you discover traces of the divine war:
- **Angelic murals**: Faded paintings depicting celestial battles, with angels wielding flaming swords against demonic hordes
- **Demon-carved warnings**: Infernal script burned into walls: "The mortals must not reach the rift's heart"
- **Frozen battles**: Chambers where angels and demons fought to the death, their corpses perfectly preserved
- **Divine altars**: Shrines to various gods, some still radiating power, others cracked and abandoned
- **Mortal prayers**: Scrawled messages from long-dead priests begging the gods to stop the war
- **Rift echoes**: Areas where reality is thin—you can hear the sounds of the celestial war raging beyond
- **Relics of power**: Weapons, armor, and artifacts left behind by fallen champions of both sides

## The Central Mystery

The deeper you delve into the dungeons, the more you uncover disturbing truths:
- The divine war wasn't an accident—it was **orchestrated**
- Someone manipulated the gods into conflict, knowing it would tear open the rift
- That entity waits at the heart of Zot, beyond the reach of angels and demons
- They've been waiting for someone strong enough to claim the Orb
- And when you finally reach them, they'll reveal why they remember you...

**Who are you, really?**
- A descendant of the one who started the war?
- A reincarnated angel or demon, stripped of memory?
- A pawn in a cosmic game between the gods?
- Or something else entirely—something that even the gods fear?

**Final revelation**: The Orb of Zot is not a tool to close the rift. It IS the rift—condensed into physical form. Whoever wields it becomes the arbiter of reality itself.

**Your choice:**
- **Close the rift**: End the war, but seal away the celestial realms forever. The gods will fade. Magic will die. But Earth will heal.
- **Expand the rift**: Let the realms merge completely. Chaos eternal, but infinite power for those who can take it.
- **Claim the Orb**: Become a god yourself. Rule over the wasteland with divine authority.
- **Destroy the Orb**: Shatter it and let the pieces fall where they may. No one controls the rift—not you, not the gods, not anyone.

Whatever you choose will shape the future of the wasteland—and the fate of every soul caught in the divine war.
