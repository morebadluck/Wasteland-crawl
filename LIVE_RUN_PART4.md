# 🎮 Wasteland Crawl - LIVE RUN Part 4: THE DEEP RUINS

## 📍 Starting Position

**Turn 651**: TestSurvivor stands at the stairs to Level 5
**Status**: Level 5 Minotaur Berserker, HP 40/40, 2 heal wound potions
**Equipment**: +1 Long sword, Chain mail (AC 7)

---

## ⬇️ DESCENT TO LEVEL 5

### Turn 651-660: Into the Deep

```
> You take a deep breath and descend...

The stairs creak ominously. You're going deeper than most survivors dare.

Welcome to Level 5 of the Dungeon!

The air is thick with dust. Old warning signs on the walls are barely visible.
"RESTRICTED AREA - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"

This must have been a secure facility before the collapse...
```

**Immediate Observations:**
- Darker corridors
- More rubble and debris
- Larger rooms visible ahead
- Ominous silence...

```
Auto-exploring...

Turn 655: You open a rusty door...
Turn 656: A HUGE shape moves in the darkness!

An OGRE comes into view!
```

---

## 💀 CREATURE SPOTLIGHT: OGRE (First Encounter!)

```
Name: Ogre (Hulking Mutant)
HD: 7 (MASSIVE upgrade from previous threats!)
Speed: 10 (SLOW - advantage!)
Intelligence: Human
Damage: Giant club 17 (CAN ONE-SHOT YOU!)
Special: ENORMOUS HP pool
Threat Level: DEADLY
```

**In wasteland terms**: "A massive humanoid mutant, easily 9 feet tall. Hideously deformed but incredibly strong. Carries a concrete column as a weapon. Its eyes are small and piggish but filled with cunning. This thing could crush a car."

**My reaction**: "OH NO. This is the mid-game wall. If that club hits me, I'm DEAD."

---

### Turn 657-680: The Ogre Fight

```
Turn 657: You assess the situation

HP: 40/40
Ogre HP: ~60+ (estimated)
Damage: My hits ~12-15, Ogre hits ~17
Math: Ogre can kill me in 2-3 hits
      I need ~5-6 hits to kill it

Options:
A) Fight normally (RISKY - one bad round = death)
B) BERSERK NOW (smart! 2x damage, finish fast)
C) Teleport away (cowardly but safe)
```

**DECISION: BERSERK IMMEDIATELY!**

```
Turn 658: You call upon Trog!

*** You go berserk! ***
Trog grants you RAGE!

Your muscles bulge with supernatural strength!
HP: 40/40 (berserk HP bonus)
Damage: DOUBLED!

Turn 659: You charge the ogre!
Turn 660: You swing with ALL YOUR MIGHT!

*** You hit the ogre with your long sword! ***
26 DAMAGE! (berserk power!)

The ogre is SEVERELY wounded already!

Turn 661: The ogre swings its club!
The ogre MISSES! (thank Trog!)

Turn 662: You attack again!
HIT for 24 DAMAGE!

*** The ogre dies! ***

HP: 40/40 (took NO damage!)
XP: 25/50 (huge XP gain!)
```

**VICTORY!** But that was TERRIFYING!

```
HP: 40/40
Berserk active for 12 more turns
Exhausted when it ends
```

### Turn 681-700: Berserk Exploration

## 💬 MY THOUGHTS

**After 820 turns:**

"That ogre scared the HELL out of me. When I saw 'giant club 17' I knew one hit could end the run. Berserking immediately was the right call.

The centaur warrior + orc priest combo was BRUTAL. Ranged damage from TWO sources means you're taking hits no matter what. That police station fight was the hardest yet.

But now I'm Level 6 with 12 AC and a +2 sword. I feel POWERFUL. The vaults keep getting better - that police armory was perfectly themed.

We've seen OGRES now. The mid-game wall is real. But we survived!"
