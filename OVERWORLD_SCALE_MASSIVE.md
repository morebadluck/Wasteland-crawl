### **How D&D Modules Work:**

```
1. FIXED LOCATIONS
   - Unlike random dungeons, these have exact coordinates
   - Marked on map once discovered
   - Can be legendary quest destinations

2. HAND-CRAFTED
   - Not procedurally generated
   - Every room is designed
   - Follows original module layout

3. NAMED
   - "You discover: THE TOMB OF THE FIRST LICH"
   - Reputation: "Only 3 survivors ever returned"
   - Special loot: Unique artifacts

4. OPTIONAL BUT REWARDING
   - Not required for main progression
   - Extra challenge for veterans
   - Best loot in the game

5. CONVERTED LORE
   - D&D fantasy → Post-apocalyptic
   - Dungeons → Bunkers/Facilities
   - Magic → Radiation/Technology
   - Gods → Pre-war corporations/AI
```

   - Planning matters
   - Resources matter
   - Fast travel is VALUABLE

✅ **Difficulty Through Distance**
   - Natural progression
   - Can't accidentally wander into late-game

✅ **Exploration Reward**
   - Finding a dungeon in Ring 6 feels EARNED
   - "I made it this far!"

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### **Technical Considerations:**

```
Minecraft World Border: 59,999,968 blocks
Our World: 100,000 blocks diameter (well within limits!)

Performance:
- Load chunks dynamically (Minecraft handles this)
- Only render nearby regions
- Unload far chunks automatically
- Should run smoothly on mid-range PCs

Generation Time:
- Pre-generate rings as player explores
- Generate 1-2 rings ahead
- ~10 minutes to generate full world (one-time)

Save File Size:
- Estimate: 2-5 GB for full explored world
- Reasonable for modern gaming
```
