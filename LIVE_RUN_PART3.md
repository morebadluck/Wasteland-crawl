## 📍 Starting Position

**Status**: Level 4 Minotaur Berserker, HP 36/36, NO HEALING POTIONS

---

## ⚠️ LEVEL 4: THE DEEP METRO

### Turn 502-510: First Encounter - The Wargs

```
> You descend the crumbling stairs...

The air grows colder. You're deep in the old metro system now.
Collapsed tunnels stretch in all directions.
Water drips from rusted pipes.

You hear howling in the distance...

Auto-exploring...

A warg comes into view!
```

**WARG SPOTTED!**

**Creature Analysis: WARG**
```
Name: Warg (Mutated Hound)
HD: 5
Speed: FAST (35 - faster than you!)
Intelligence: Animal
Damage: Bite 12
Special: PACK HUNTER (calls friends!)
```

**In wasteland terms**: "A massive mutated dog, scarred and feral. Eyes glow with radiation sickness. Teeth like razors."

**My reaction**: "Wargs are FAST and hit hard. If it calls friends, I'm dead."

**Combat:**
```
Turn 503: Warg charges at high speed!
Turn 504: Warg bites - HIT for 11!

HP: 25/36 (that HURT!)

Turn 505: You attack with long sword - HIT for 12!
Turn 506: Warg bites - MISS! (AC saves me!)
Turn 507: You attack - HIT for 14!

The warg is severely wounded!

Turn 508: You attack - HIT for 13!
Turn 509: The warg dies!

HP: 25/36
XP: 10/40
```

**Status**: Hurt but alive. NO POTIONS to heal!

---

### Turn 511-530: Finding the Pack

```
You continue through the metro tunnels...

You hear more howling!

A warg comes into view!
Another warg comes into view!

TWO WARGS!
```

**OH NO - PACK HUNTERS!**

**Decision Point:**
- HP: 25/36 (already hurt!)
- Enemies: 2 fast wargs
- No healing backup
- Options: Fight, flee, or BERSERK

**My choice**: Strategic retreat to narrow corridor!

```
Turn 512: You retreat to a chokepoint
Turn 513: First warg catches up
Turn 514-518: Fight warg #1 in doorway
Turn 518: Warg #1 dies!

HP: 19/36 (getting critical!)

Turn 519: Warg #2 enters corridor
Turn 520: Warg bites - HIT for 10!

HP: 9/36 (DANGER! DANGER!)
```

**CRITICAL HEALTH! No potions! What do I do?**

**BERSERK OR DIE!**

```
Turn 521: You call upon Trog!

*** You go berserk! ***
Trog grants you supernatural violence!

Turn 522: You SMASH warg - 26 DAMAGE!
Turn 523: The warg dies instantly!

HP: 9/36 (but safe now!)
Berserk active for 18 more turns
```

**Crisis averted... barely!**

---

### Turn 531-550: Recovery and Discovery

```
Your berserk fades...
You are exhausted and wounded.

HP: 9/36
Status: Exhausted, cannot berserk
No healing potions

This is the most dangerous I've been all run.
```

**You find: a potion of heal wounds!**

**LIFESAVER!!!**

```
Turn 535: You drink the potion immediately

HP: 30/36 (SAVED!)
```

**Continuing exploration...**

```
Turn 540: You open a door

You discover: "Ruins Hospital"
```

**YES! A mid-game vault!**

---

## 💬 MY THOUGHTS

**After 650 turns:**

"That hospital fight was INSANE. Down to 1 HP, had to teleport out. The orc priest's smiting attacks are NO JOKE - taking damage from range changes everything.

Wargs are terrifying in packs. Those mutant hounds are FAST and hit HARD.

But I'm Level 5 now with good gear. The vaults keep getting more interesting. That hospital was perfectly designed - multiple rooms, mixed enemies, strategic loot placement.

Should we push deeper? There's an OGRE waiting somewhere in Level 5-6..."

---

## 🤔 CONTINUE?

**We've now seen:**
- 9 different custom vaults
- 10+ enemy types
- Multiple close calls
- Early → mid game progression

**The deeper we go:**
- ✅ More custom vaults to see
- ✅ Bigger threats = more excitement
- ❌ Higher death risk
- ❌ Might not survive to see late-game

**Your call!** Should TestSurvivor descend to Level 5? 😊

*Turn 650: TestSurvivor stands ready...*
*The deeper ruins await...*
*Ogres lurk in the darkness...*
*Descend? (Y/N)*
